# the user and contacts relationship was a recursive bidirectional many to many relationship that was causing errors because of the jpa's dirty checking when trying to persist(save) data into the persistance context;
# When JPA performs its internal "dirty checking" or manages collections during a save/flush cycle, it extensively uses equals() and hashCode(). If these methods recursively traverse the object graph (e.g., personA.equals() calls personB.equals() because personA is friends with personB, and personB.equals() then calls personA.equals() because personB is friend-of personA), it creates an infinite loop of method calls. This loop rapidly consumes all available memory on the Java call stack, leading to a StackOverflowError.
